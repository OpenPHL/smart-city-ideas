## Tower Sites

There are **25 tower sites** under long term lease with the City located at key access points throughout Philadelphia. The City spends significant funds every year to lease and maintain these tower sites via fiber connection that sits idle. The 25 tower sites were leased as part of a project to provide citywide wi-fi a decade ago, which was unsuccessful for various reasons. Providers interested in using the tower sites will have the opportunity to take over the leases. If the solution requires installatio n of different equipment at different heights, the leases will have to be renegotiated. See Appendix B for tower sites.

## Existing fiber

All of the tower sites are connected through leased fiber, which is terminated at each site. It would be the vendor’s responsibility to initiate new leases.

## Public Safety Spectrum

The City has access to public safety spectrum in the 4.9 GHz range for use by public safety applications if the selected vendor can integrate such into the proposal. Primary uses of the 4.9 GHz band are for hot spots, point-to-multi-point, base/mobile/portable operations, broadband permanent fixed point-to-point links, and temporary fixed point-to-point. Communications must be related to the protection of life, health or property. Unattended and continuous operation is permitted. Voice, data and video operations are permitted.

## Street light poles

The City lighting system is comprised of 105,000 roadway lights; 18,640 alley lights; 5,000 ped estrian scale or ornamental lights; and 400 park lights. A portion of these assets would be available for this project. Selected vendors would have access to both street light pole power supply and the physical infrastructure. This does not include access to wood utility poles.

## Right-of-way access to tunnels, water mains, and sewers

**Right-of-way access to tunnels, water mains, and sewers** that is critical to the solution’s functionality and scale.

## Additional Assets

The City is interested in and open to the idea of providing access to **additional assets** (facilities, buildings, street furniture, etc.) that strengthen the solution’s potential to deliver revenue and public value. Providers are encouraged to be creative and consider a diverse array of potential uses such as public wi-fi, public safety, and the use of sensor technology to support various IoE (Internet of Everything) devices. Although additional assets cannot be promised at this stage, inspiring ideas will be taken into consideration during the development of any Request for Proposals.
