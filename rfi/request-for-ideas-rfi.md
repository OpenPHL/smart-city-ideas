# Request for Ideas (RFI)

The City of Philadelphia is interested in determining if the existing assets outlined in [Section 4](assets.md) could be leveraged to better city operations and services. The City seeks information and ideas on any products and technologies that could use the se assets as a platform to improve public safety, public infrastructure maintenance, energy efficiency, public space management, transportation and quality of life for the residents and businesses of Philadelphia.

Listed below are some examples of Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities that would enhance the City’s ability to deliver quality services to Philadelphians. Proposed solutions should be designed to allow for adapting, upgrading and integrating additional functionality. The list is not intended to be exhaustive and r esponders are encouraged to share additional ideas.

- **Meter Reading:** Remote meter - reading that allows information to be collected and forwarded to the Water Department for billing purposes.
- **Street Lighting Controls:** Dynamic lighting systems that can be controlled remotely, react to citizens, provide valuable data, and\/or reduce energy costs.
- **Gunshot Detection:** Detection devices that can identify a gunshot and send the information to the City’s 911 Center while simultaneously alerting the City’s cameras in the vicinity to focus in on the location.
- **Transportation Analytics:** Technologies that can detect changes in traffic flows, pedestrian and cyclist activity, and parking availability.
- **Infrastructure Monitoring:** Detection and monitor ing of the City’s critical infrastructure such as roads, bridges, airports, water, and power systems.
- **Public Safety Surveillance:** Additional video surveillance points and cameras, used exclusively for public safety purposes, which police could monitor, especially in high crime areas.
- **Free, high-speed public wi-fi:** Wi-fi that would support communities of mobile / flexible workers and improve overall lifestyles in the form of greater productivity and services, improved planning and development, collaboration in the digital era, and economic growth.
- **Sensor Technology:** Combined monitoring with sensor technology that collects data in real time. For example, the City would know when a street has iced over so salt crews can be dispatched.

The City seeks submissions that address one, some or all of the capabilities above. Any additional ideas that advance city operations are welcome. The optimal submission would address a number of capabi lities with one single solution, and the City is interested in ideas of what can be accomplished in public - private partnerships and entering into revenue shari ng agreements with selected vendor\(s\). The City is open to piloting solutions in specific areas within the City.
