# Smart City RFI: Using Technology to Create a Smart City

This repository contains a modified copy of [*Using Technology to Create a Smart City*](http://www.phila.gov/rfp/Documents/RFI_SmartCity_CityofPhila_OIT_FINAL.pdf), a Request for Information (RFI) published by the City of Philadelphia's Office of Innovation and Technology (OIT). The document has been converted to the [GitBook](http://gitbook.com) format with minimal changes to content, both to illustrate how GitBook can be used and to provide the RFI in more accessible formats than the PDF originally published by the City.
